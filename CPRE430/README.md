# CPRE430: Networking Protocols & Security

Welcome to the CPRE430 repository! In this course, we combined protocol theory with hands-on experimentation to understand, measure, and secure modern networks.

---

## 🛠 Core Topics

1. **TCP/IP Protocol Suite**  
   - Detailed exploration of IPv4/IPv6 headers, TCP three‐way handshake, windowing, and congestion control.  
   - Comparison of TCP vs. UDP semantics and use cases.

2. **Packet Analysis & Tools**  
   - Packet capture and deep inspection using **Wireshark**.  

3. **Network Security**  
   - Penetration test understanding: ARP spoofing, TCP SYN flood simulations, and mitigation strategies.

## 🔍 Lab Highlights

- **Network Sniffing with Wireshark**: Captured and dissected live packet streams to inspect TCP/IP headers, decode application protocols, and identify anomalous traffic patterns.  
- **SSH Tunneling & Email Inspection**: Created SSH tunnels to intercept and analyze MIME-encoded email exchanges (SMTP/IMAP), gaining deep insights into message encapsulation and security mechanisms.

## 🚀 Learning Outcomes

- Proficient in dissecting and constructing protocol headers.  
- Experienced in building, troubleshooting, and securing virtual network environments.  
- Skilled at interpreting network traces.  
- Familiar with common network attack vectors and corresponding defense mechanisms.
