## 🛠 Key Modules

1. **Hazard Analysis Techniques**  
   - **Fault Tree Analysis (FTA)** and **Software Fault Tree Analysis (SFTA)** to deconstruct system failures.  

2. **Safety Requirements & Design**  
   - Derivation of software safety requirements using Leveson’s Safeware framework.  
   - Architectural patterns for fail-safe and fault-tolerant behaviors in safety‐critical modules.

3. **Verification & Testing**  
   - Static code analysis on sample scenarios (e.g., Mars Lander).  
   - Understanding of test harnesses for devices lacking built-in diagnosability (e.g., surgical robots).

4. **Standards & Certification**  
   - Exploration of IEC 61508 guidelines.  
   - Case studies on compliance workflows and documentation artifacts.
