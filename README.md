## 🚀 Highlights

* **OverTheWire Solutions Guide**  
  In-depth, level-by-level write-ups for the Bandit challenges. Demonstrates Linux command-line mastery, problem-solving, and documentation skills.

* **Python Networking Experiments**  
  A collection of custom Python tools—port scanners, packet sniffers, TCP/UDP demos—showcasing socket programming and protocol analysis.

* **COMS309 Coursework**  
  Lead backend developer on a student-focused job-search platform: designed RESTful APIs, structured MySQL databases, and automated deployments with CI/CD pipelines.

* **CPRE381 Coursework**  
  Engineered pipelined CPU designs and VHDL simulations to explore ISA design, hazard detection, and memory hierarchy performance trade‑offs.

* **CPRE430 Coursework**  
  Simulated network topologies and packet-level interactions to explore TCP/IP protocol design, IP routing mechanisms, and network security vulnerabilities.

* **COMS415 Coursework**  
  Conducted systematic hazard and failure analyses (FTA, SFMECA) and employed formal verification and static analysis to identify, prioritize, and mitigate risks in safety-critical software systems.

* **Achievements & Certifications**  
  President’s List (CGPA 3.85/4.00), CompTIA Security+, CCNA (in progress).
